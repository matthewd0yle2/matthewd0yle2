>### Profile
>With my PhD in Quantum Turbulence completed: I am now looking for exciting opportunities to work with code in industry or academia; while enchancing my general coding, machine learning, and front-end skills. 

### 2 Programming Goals for 2025
- Release a 2D video game on Steam. (I'm hoping to power this with PyGame and pixel art assets)
- Publish an interactive web-application to solve a simple problem (no log-in, minor data-tracking, simple user experience)
